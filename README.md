📝 Roadmap
Now, let's outline completed milestones and upcoming features.
 
🔷 Phase 1: Core SQL Execution Engine (✅ Completed)
✅ SQL Parser & Execution
•	SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
•	WHERE Filtering (=, <, >, <=, >=, !=)
•	Advanced WHERE Conditions (AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN)
✅ Data Storage
•	JSON-based persistent storage for tables
✅ Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI)
•	Interactive SQL REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
✅ Basic Error Handling
•	Detect invalid columns, missing tables, and syntax errors
 
🔷 Phase 2: Query Enhancements (✅ Completed)
✅ Sorting & Pagination
•	ORDER BY col [ASC|DESC]
•	LIMIT N and OFFSET M
✅ Safe UPDATE & DELETE
•	Warning for full-table updates
•	Type validation for updates
✅ NULL Handling & Safe Type Casting
•	NULL values supported in filtering, updates, and joins
 
🔷 Phase 3: Performance Improvements (✅ Completed)
✅ Indexing Basics
•	Optimized JSON read/write
•	Improved WHERE clause performance by caching frequently accessed data
✅ JOIN Query Optimizations
•	Implemented hash-based indexing for faster lookups
✅ Data Integrity Checks
•	Prevented updates to primary keys (id)
•	Warn users if attempting to JOIN on mismatched data types
 
🔷 Phase 4: JOIN Support & Multi-Table Queries (✅ Completed)
✅ JOIN Types Implemented
•	INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN
✅ JOIN Optimizations
•	Prefixed column names (users.id, orders.id) to avoid conflicts
•	JOIN Indexing (faster lookup for large datasets)
✅ JOIN Edge Cases Handled
•	Missing foreign keys handled gracefully (NULL values in LEFT JOIN)
•	Prevention of Cartesian Products (CROSS JOIN only when explicitly requested)
 
🔷 Phase 5: Aggregation Functions & GROUP BY (✅ Completed)
✅ Aggregation Functions
•	SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
✅ GROUP BY & HAVING
•	SELECT department, SUM(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
•	SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
✅ DISTINCT Queries
•	SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;
 
🔷 Phase 6: Transactions & Multi-User Support (✅ Completed)
✅ Transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
•	Prevent data corruption by ensuring atomic execution
✅ Savepoints
•	Implemented rollback checkpoints within transactions
✅ Concurrency Control (Basic)
•	Support for read/write isolation
✅ Logging & Recovery
•	Transaction logs for crash recovery

Upcoming: 
 
🛡️ Phase 7: Security & Access Control
🚀 Now, we begin implementing security features!
🔜 Step 1: Authentication & Role-Based Access Control
•	CREATE USER john IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
•	GRANT SELECT ON employees TO john;
•	REVOKE UPDATE ON employees FROM john;
🔜 Step 2: SQL Firewall (Preventing SQL Injection)
•	Prevent SQL Injection Attacks
•	Sanitize all user input
🔜 Step 3: Data Encryption for Secure Storage
•	Implement AES encryption for sensitive data
🔜 Step 4: Audit Logging & Intrusion Detection
•	Keep logs of all queries executed (for debugging & security audits)
•	Detect unauthorized login attempts
 
🔴 Phase 8: "White Hat" Hacking Phase
✅ Once security features are implemented, we will try to break them!
🔴 Attack 1: Bypass Authentication
•	Try SQL Injection on login (' OR 1=1 --)
🔴 Attack 2: Escalate Privileges
•	Try getting unauthorized GRANT access
🔴 Attack 3: Inject Malicious Queries
•	Bypass the firewall rules
🔴 Attack 4: Read & Decrypt Encrypted Data
•	Try extracting sensitive data from the database
🔴 Attack 5: Cover Our Tracks
•	Attempt log tampering & forensic evasion
✅ Once vulnerabilities are found, we will patch them & strengthen security!
 
🔷 Phase 9: Advanced Optimizations & Scalability
🔜 Indexing Enhancements
•	B-Tree and Hash Indexes for faster queries
🔜 Query Execution Plans
•	Implement EXPLAIN ANALYZE to optimize slow queries
🔜 Parallel Query Execution
•	Utilize multi-threading for faster performance
🔜 Sharding & Replication
•	Scale across multiple database files
 
🔷 Phase 10: Future Expansion
🔜 Stored Procedures & Functions
•	Custom SQL logic inside the database
🔜 Triggers
•	Automate actions before/after INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
🔜 Views & Materialized Views
•	CREATE VIEW active_users AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1;
🔜 Foreign Key Constraints
•	Prevent orphaned records & ensure relational integrity
🔜 JSON Query Support
•	SELECT data->>'first_name' FROM customers;
